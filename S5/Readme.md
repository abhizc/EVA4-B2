# Results

## First Code file


**Target:** lightest working model within the target Parameter

1.   Added GAP layer to reduce parameters

**Results:**


1.   Parameters: 8,412
2.   Best Train Accuracy: 98.48%
3.   Best Test Accuracy: 98.58%


**Analysis:**

No over-fitting, Train and Test accuracy difference is ver low.

Accuracy needs to be improved

## Second Code file

**Target:** To increase the accuracy

1.   Adding Batch normalization

**Results:**


1.   Parameters: 8,604
2.   Best Train Accuracy: 99.24%
3.   Best Test Accuracy: 98.93%


**Analysis:**

Model over-fitting.

Test Accuracy needs to be improved


## Third Code file

**Target:** To reduce Over fitting 

1.   Adding Drop out
2.   Adding additional layer



**Results:**


1.   Parameters: 9,924
2.   Best Train Accuracy: 98.74%
3.   Best Test Accuracy: 99.09%


**Analysis:**

Accuracy reached aboved 99% consistently 
but still target is not achieved

## Forth code file
